## Learning from Documentation
I executed the `/challenge/challenge --giveflag` command in the terminal, which successfully provided the flag.

## Learning Complex Usage
I ran the command `/challenge/challenge --printfile /flag` in the terminal, which also successfully retrieved the flag.

## Reading Manuals
I ran the `man challenge` command in the terminal to access the manual for the challenge command.  
In the SYNOPSIS and DESCRIPTION sections, I found the following information:

### NAME
`/challenge/challenge` - Print the flag!

### SYNOPSIS
`challenge OPTION`

### DESCRIPTION
Output the flag when called with the right arguments.

- `--fortune`: Read a fortune.
- `--version`: Output version information and exit.
- `--kkvcpj NUM`: Print the flag if NUM is 838.

I then executed the command `/challenge/challenge --kkvcpj 838` in the terminal, which successfully retrieved the flag.

## Searching Manuals
I executed the `man challenge` command in the terminal to read the manual for the challenge command.  
I used the `/` key to search for "flag" within the manual and discovered the following information in the DESCRIPTION section:

- `--fztkts`: This argument will give you the flag!

After exiting the manual by pressing `q`, I ran the command `/challenge/challenge --fztkts` in the terminal, which successfully retrieved the flag.
