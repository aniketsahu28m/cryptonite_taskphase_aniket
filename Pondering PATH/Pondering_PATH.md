### Pondering PATH

#### The PATH Variable
I cleared the `PATH` variable by running `PATH=""` in the terminal.  
Then, I executed `/challenge/run` to try running the command with the empty `PATH`.

#### Setting PATH
I updated the `PATH` by setting it to `/challenge/more_commands` with the command `PATH=/challenge/more_commands`.  
After that, I ran `/challenge/run` again to execute the command.
